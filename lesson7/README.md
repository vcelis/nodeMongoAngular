<h1>Lesson 7: Implementing the Full Node.js, MongoDB, and AngularJS Stack to Provide a Dynamic View of Backend Data</h1>
<p>
In Lesson 7, you use the full Node.js, MongoDB, and AngularJS stack to access and display data from the MongoDB database in a dynamic view. You begin by creating a dynamic HTML table that is bound to data from the MongoDB database. Then you add the capability to page through entries in the collection. Next, you add the capability to filter data in the application. Finally, you add a sort feature to sort the document based on different field values.
